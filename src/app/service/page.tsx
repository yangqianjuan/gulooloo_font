          <h2>Waiver and Severability</h2>
          <p>
            No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or
            continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Gulooloo
            Tech&apos;s failure to assert any right or provision under this
            Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

          <p>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court to be invalid, illegal,
            or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated
            or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions
            of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
